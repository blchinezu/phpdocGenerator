# phpdocGenerator
A web interface for generating documentation with phpDocumentor 2

You can download phpDocumentor from http://phpdoc.org/

I **recommend** running the interface under a **Linux** web server.  
I **didn't test** it under a **Windows** machine.

It's not perfect but it provides a decent interface for generating docs.
